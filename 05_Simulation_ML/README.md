Today, we're learning about coupling simulations and machine learning.

1. First, [here](05_Simulation_ML/Background.md) we will talk about why we would want to couple simulations & ML and describe ways to do it.
2. Then, [here](05_Simulation_ML/HandsOn.md) we will work through our hands-on example with one way to couple Python and C++.
3. For extra tips for using the Python and Numpy C APIs, check out [this page](05_Simulation_ML/Tips.md).
