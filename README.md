# ALCF: Simulation, Data, and Learning Workshop for AI
### Dec 8 - 10, 2020
### Agenda: https://events.cels.anl.gov/event/41/timetable/#20201208

The ALCF regularly hosts a simulation, data, and learning workshop to help users scale their data science workflows. This workshop focuses on AI capabilities at scale.

### The repo is divided by the workshop sessions:
   * [Introductory material (review on your own prior to workshop)](00_pre_workshop_materials)
   * [Distributed Deep Learning](01_distributedDeepLearning)
   * [Building Effective Data Pipelines for CPU/GPU systems](02_dataPipelines)
   * [Hyperparameter Optimization using DeepHyper on ALCF Systems](03_distributedHyperOpt)
   * [Profiling Deep Learning applications](04_profilingDeepLearning)
   * [Integrating inference in to simulation](05_Simulation_ML)
